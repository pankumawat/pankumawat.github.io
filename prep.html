In software development, Object-Oriented Design plays a crucial role when it comes to writing flexible, scalable, maintainable, and reusable code. There are so many benefits of using OOD but every developer should also have the knowledge of the SOLID principle for good object-oriented design in programming. The SOLID principle was introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob and it is a coding standard in programming. This principle is an acronym of the five principles which is given below…

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open/Closed Principle
Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
SOLID-Principle-in-Programming-Understand-With-Real-Life-Examples

The SOLID principle helps in reducing tight coupling. Tight coupling means a group of classes are highly dependent on one another which you should avoid in your code. Opposite of tight coupling is loose coupling and your code is considered as a good code when it has loosely-coupled classes. Loosely coupled classes minimize changes in your code, helps in making code more reusable, maintainable, flexible and stable. Now let’s discuss one by one these principles…

1. Single Responsibility Principle: This principle states that “a class should have only one reason to change” which means every class should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose. Take the example of developing software. The task is divided into different members doing different things as front-end designers do design, the tester does testing and backend developer takes care of backend development part then we can say that everyone has a single job or responsibility.
Most of the time it happens that when programmers have to add features or new behavior they implement everything into the existing class which is completely wrong. It makes their code lengthy, complex and consumes time when later something needs to be modified. Use layers in your application and break God classes into smaller classes or modules.


2. Open/Closed Principle: This principle states that “software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification” which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.
Suppose developer A needs to release an update for a library or framework and developer B wants some modification or add some feature on that then developer B is allowed to extend the existing class created by developer A but developer B is not supposed to modify the class directly. Using this principle separates the existing code from the modified code so it provides better stability, maintainability and minimizes changes as in your code.

3. Liskov’s Substitution Principle: The principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987 and according to this principle “Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes“. This principle ensures that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behavior.
You can understand it in a way that a farmer’s son should inherit farming skills from his father and should be able to replace his father if needed. If the son wants to become a farmer then he can replace his father but if he wants to become a cricketer then definitely the son can’t replace his father even though they both belong to the same family hierarchy.
One of the classic examples of this principle is a rectangle having four sides. A rectangle’s height can be any value and width can be any value. A square is a rectangle with equal width and height. So we can say that we can extend the properties of the rectangle class into square class. In order to do that you need to swap the child (square) class with parent (rectangle) class to fit the definition of a square having four equal sides but a derived class does not affect the behavior of the parent class so if you will do that it will violate the Liskov Substitution Principle. Check the link Liskov Substitution Principle for better understanding.

4. Interface Segregation Principle: This principle is the first principle that applies to Interfaces instead of classes in SOLID and it is similar to the single responsibility principle. It states that “do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them“. Here your main goal is to focus on avoiding fat interface and give preference to many small client-specific interfaces. You should prefer many client interfaces rather than one general interface and each interface should have a specific responsibility.
Suppose if you enter a restaurant and you are pure vegetarian. The waiter in that restaurant gave you the menu card which includes vegetarian items, non-vegetarian items, drinks, and sweets. In this case, as a customer, you should have a menu card which includes only vegetarian items, not everything which you don’t eat in your food. Here the menu should be different for different types of customers. The common or general menu card for everyone can be divided into multiple cards instead of just one. Using this principle helps in reducing the side effects and frequency of required changes.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle: Before we discuss this topic keep in mind that Dependency Inversion and Dependency Injection both are different concepts. Most of the people get confused about it and consider both are the same. Now two key points are here to keep in mind about this principle

High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
The above lines simply state that if a high module or class will be dependent more on low-level modules or class then your code would have tight coupling and if you will try to make a change in one class it can break another class which is risky at the production level. So always try to make classes loosely coupled as much as you can and you can achieve this through abstraction. The main motive of this principle is decoupling the dependencies so if class A changes the class B doesn’t need to care or know about the changes.
You can consider the real-life example of a TV remote battery. Your remote needs a battery but it’s not dependent on the battery brand. You can use any XYZ brand that you want and it will work. So we can say that the TV remote is loosely coupled with the brand name. Dependency Inversion makes your code more reusable.`

									    			title: "REST Principles",
									    			desc: `
The 5 principles of REST and related concepts can be summarized and rewritten as follows:

Contract First Approach / Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs/URLs)

API specification serves as a contract between the app and the server.
URIs/URLs provide consistent access to specific data in a fixed format.
API documentation is hosted on the developer portal, e.g., developer.company.com.
Statelessness

API does not rely on past requests and maintains no client-specific state.
Each call must provide all necessary information for the server to respond.
Client-Server Model

App interfaces with the server through a database schema described in API documentation.
Interaction focuses on data format the client needs and the level of information granularity.
Server and client communication stays separated, promoting clear responsibilities.
Caching

Temporary storage of information outside the server to reduce repetitive requests.
Cache can be located near the server, in intermediary points, or on the client/app.
Helps to increase API performance, availability, and reduce traffic.
Layered Architecture

API design organized into layers, each unaware of its adjacent layers.
Promotes separation-of-concerns and scalability.
Changes in one layer can occur without affecting others.

Algorithms 

The ultimate goal is to arrive at an optimal solution by the end of the exercise. However, do not stress if the algorithm is not perfectly optimal. The interviewers are looking for you to solve most problems and to be able to apply the algorithm.

Pro-tip: Talk through your thoughts and coding with your interviewer - let them know how you think.

ALWAYS think about runtimes. Big O Notation. Understand complexities of algorithms.

Bonus points: demonstrate knowledge of whether a better algorithm could be implemented and complexity differences between the optimal algorithm and your algorithm.

Sorting

Demonstrate an understanding of sorting algorithms, their tradeoffs, and implementation of simple ones

 

Data Structures

Understand the structures and how to use it (think of lists, sets, maps, etc)

Be prepared to dissect code and use data structures to understand how it works. 

Talk about why the data structure is a good choice and discuss potential tradeoffs. 

 

Problem Solving

Your interviewers will be evaluating how you problem solve, come to a solution, etc. Interviewers are looking for you to gather the requirements and a full set of criteria needed to solve the problem presented to you.

Your interview should feel more like a dialogue - so be mindful when stating your key assumptions. Always, always, always ask clarifying questions before jumping to solutions. Example: Interviewers may want you to solve Part B so if you just start solving Part A without asking clarifying questions that’s a red flag on thought process. Make sure you are answering the right part of the problem and that you fully understand the problem. Especially if the question is open-ended.

Another way to consider this: Try to think of it as you are tutoring someone and you need to explain it thoroughly and clearly. Try to be detailed in your explanations. Always good to state other solutions that you took into account and state why you moved forward with solving the problem the way you did. This will show your breadth of knowledge.

Take advantage of any hints that interviewers give you. The hints are not that obvious, but it will guide you in the right direction.

It is ALWAYS better to ask questions - especially before you start - so you are clear on what the interviewer is asking for and looking for - and so that you have all of the info you need to appropriately tackle the problem. Better to ask more questions than none at all.

Be able to solve a problem recursively and know how to use and repurpose common recursive algorithms to solve new problems.

 

Some things to avoid:

Jumping into design or coding without first analyzing the problem/question asked. This demonstrates the inability to solve complex problems.

Making assumptions. If you do make assumptions, state that you are making an assumption and ask if that is a fair/ valid assumption.

Staying silent. Always better to talk and think out loud.

Disregarding hints.

Flipping languages mid-interview. If you start the interview coding in Java, do not end in C++. It shows bad thought process and confuses interviewers.
